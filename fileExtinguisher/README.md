## Extinguish files easily!

### This app will delete files with the same type/extension that you no longer needed.

## Case study:
##### I just want to create a script to easily remove all the .ppk files that I acquire from Python Automation course in Coursera.
##### I realized that this is also a good personal project. So I decided to work on it and make it as an app.

###### You can download the standalone app for Linux and Windows. This is tested on my Ubuntu and Windows 10.
###### Feel free to give any feedback. I appreciate your time.
