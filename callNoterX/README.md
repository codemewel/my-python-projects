NOTE! The 'Additional Info' part is not included in copying and saving. The purpose is to take note of any other info/keyword that will be given by the caller.

## Case Study
I just hired and I noticed that it is a challenge for me to use notepad in copying and pasting the info to our chat to give an update. Specially we are only using 1 monitor, you need to carefully check
and sometimes the mouse scroll slips whenever you drag to copy the info. So I think an idea why not create a simple app. Unfortunately, I'm not able to use it in production for some reason.

The installer is also included in this repo. Feel free to try it and give feedback.
